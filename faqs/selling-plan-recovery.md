# ðŸ§¯ Selling Plan Recovery

## What happens if my pre-order selling plan is deleted?

Fundpop automatically detects missing selling plans associated with your active campaigns and recreates them to prevent disruptions.

### Do I need to do anything?

In most cases, no action is required. The system restores the selling plan behind the scenes.

### What should I check if something seems off?

1. Confirm your campaign still shows Order Options correctly
2. Make a test order using the pre-order option
3. Review the Orders page to ensure status flows correctly

If issues persist, contact support.
