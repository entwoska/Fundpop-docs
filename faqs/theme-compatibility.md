# ðŸŽ­ Theme Compatibility

## Fundpop content doesnâ€™t show in my theme â€” what can I try?

1. Verify the app embed and app blocks are enabled in your theme
2. Check if your theme sections support dynamic sources/app blocks
3. Test in the Theme Editor and ensure the campaign is selected

If content still doesnâ€™t appear:

* Temporarily enable the [Theme Compatibility Override](../theme-integration/compatibility-bypass.md)
* If it works with the bypass, your theme may need manual integration
* Contact support for best-practice integration steps
