# ðŸ§­ Collection Targeting Strategies

### Why Target by Collection?

* Keep campaign messaging relevant to product categories
* Reduce visual noise on unrelated product pages
* Improve conversion with context-aware placement

### Practical Tips

* Group products with similar audiences into the same collection
* Use separate campaigns for distinct categories
* A/B test targeting sets over a week to compare outcomes
