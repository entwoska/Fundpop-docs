# 🎯 Reward Tier Best Practices

Creating compelling reward tiers isn’t just about pricing — it’s a holistic experience (offer design, storytelling, visuals, pricing, scarcity) that nudges backers toward higher‑value contributions. Use these practices to improve clarity, performance, and conversion.

## Common Best Practices

For illustration only, the following points highlight common best practices observed across successful campaigns:

### What Stands Out

**Clear Value Progression**
- Entry level → Enhanced → Bundle → Exclusive

**Consistency**
- Consistent aspect ratios across all reward images
- Unified deep‑blue color palette reinforcing brand identity
- Clean, minimalist product presentation

**Strategic Bundle Positioning**
- Third tier combines two products to increase perceived value
- Limited edition messaging creates urgency
- Fine art inclusion justifies premium pricing

## Design Principles

### Image Optimization

**Aspect Ratios**
- Use consistent dimensions across all reward tier images
- Square (`1:1`) for product showcases; `4:3` or `16:9` for lifestyle/context

**Quality Standards**
- Compress images to <300KB while maintaining crispness
- Ensure images look sharp on both mobile and desktop
- Favor high‑contrast images that stand out against your theme background

**Variant Representation**
- Show clear differences between tiers/variants
- Use overlay text or badges to highlight exclusivity
- Include size/scale references when relevant

### Layout Strategy

**Progressive Value Display**

| Tier | Relative price (guideline) |
| --- | ---:|
| Entry | $X |
| Enhanced | $X + 20–40% |
| Bundle | $X + 80–120% |
| Exclusive | $X + 250–400% |

**Hierarchy & Emphasis**
- Most popular tier: larger image or “Best Value” badge
- Limited editions: quantity counters or “Limited” badges
- Exclusive tiers: premium treatment (borders, shadows)

> Note: Some campaigns opt for a natural product progression (no explicit bundles) and surface progress directly on product cards. When this fits your catalog better than reward bundles, leverage the Fundpop Product Card Progress Bar to highlight momentum on collection and product pages. See: [Product Card Progress Bar](../widgets/product-card-progress-bar.md).

### Content Strategy

**Tier Naming**
- Avoid generic names like “Tier 1, 2, 3”
- Use descriptive, benefit‑focused names (e.g., Essential, Collector’s, Artist’s Edition, Patron)

**Description Length**
- Keep copy scannable (2–3 bullet points)
- Lead with the most compelling benefit
- End with urgency/scarcity when applicable

## Implementation Checklist

### Before Launch
- [ ] Test all images on mobile devices
- [ ] Verify consistent loading speeds
- [ ] Check contrast against your store background
- [ ] Ensure alt text is descriptive for accessibility
- [ ] Preview tiers in your actual Fundpop widget

### During Campaign
- [ ] Monitor which tiers perform best
- [ ] A/B test reward images if conversion is low
- [ ] Update quantities for limited tiers
- [ ] Adjust tier visibility based on performance

### Post‑Campaign Analysis
- [ ] Review conversion rates by tier
- [ ] Analyze which visual elements drove decisions
- [ ] Document learnings for future campaigns

## Advanced Techniques

### Psychological Pricing
Recommended pricing gaps (guidelines):
- Enhanced: +20–40% vs Entry
- Bundle: +80–120% vs Entry
- Exclusive: +250–400% vs Entry

These create clear decision points without overwhelming choice.

### Scarcity Messaging
- “Limited Edition of 200” creates urgency
- Consider countdown timers for time‑limited tiers
- Use “Only X remaining” for quantity‑limited rewards

### Bundle Strategy
- Combine complementary products rather than unrelated items
- Make bundle savings explicit and visible
- Ensure the bundle enhances the core offer

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

| Issue | Why it hurts | Fix |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Inconsistent image sizes | Unprofessional, breaks grid rhythm | Standardize ratios and dimensions |
| Too many tier options (choice paralysis) | Lowers conversion | Limit to 3–5 strong options, highlight a “Best Value” |
| Unclear value differences between tiers | Backers can’t justify price jumps | Bullet benefits; show what’s added per tier |
| Generic product shots lacking exclusivity or emotion | Fails to convey premium value | Use lifestyle, detail crops, or badges (Limited, Signed) |
| Missing mobile optimization | Primary device degrades experience | Test on devices; compress <300KB; check contrast |

## Key Takeaways

1. Consistency builds trust
2. Clear value progression drives upgrades
3. Scarcity creates urgency
4. Bundle intelligently to enhance the core offer
5. Test and iterate based on performance
