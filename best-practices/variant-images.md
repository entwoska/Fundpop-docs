## Case Study: Ben Thouard‚Äôs ‚ÄúAqua Obscura‚Äù (Hemeria)

This underwater photography campaign showcases excellent reward tier design:

### What They Did Right

**Clear Value Progression**
- Entry Level: Book - Preorder Discount (‚Ç¨55)
- Mid‚ÄëTier: Signed Edition (‚Ç¨75)
- Premium: Aqua Obscura + Turbulences (‚Ç¨110)
- Exclusive: Limited Edition of 200 + Fine Art (‚Ç¨250)

**Visual Consistency**
- Consistent aspect ratios across all reward images
- Unified deep‚Äëblue color palette reinforcing brand identity
- Clean, minimalist product presentation

**Strategic Bundle Positioning**
- Third tier combines two products to increase perceived value
- Limited edition messaging creates urgency
- Fine art inclusion justifies premium pricing

## Visual Design Principles

### Image Optimization

**Aspect Ratios**
- Use consistent dimensions across all reward tier images
- Square (1:1) for product showcases; 4:3 or 16:9 for lifestyle/context

**Quality Standards**
- Compress images to <300KB while maintaining crispness
- Ensure images look sharp on both mobile and desktop
- Favor high‚Äëcontrast visuals that stand out against your theme background

**Variant Representation**
- Show clear differences between tiers/variants
- Use overlay text or badges to highlight exclusivity
- Include size/scale references when relevant

### Layout Strategy

**Progressive Value Display**
```
Entry ‚Üí Enhanced ‚Üí Bundle ‚Üí Exclusive
‚Ç¨X    ‚Üí ‚Ç¨X+36%  ‚Üí ‚Ç¨X+100% ‚Üí ‚Ç¨X+355%
```

**Visual Hierarchy**
- Most popular tier: larger image or ‚ÄúBest Value‚Äù badge
- Limited editions: quantity counters or ‚ÄúLimited‚Äù badges
- Exclusive tiers: premium treatment (borders, shadows)

### Content Strategy

**Tier Naming**
- Avoid generic names like ‚ÄúTier 1, 2, 3‚Äù
- Use descriptive, benefit‚Äëfocused names (e.g., Essential, Collector‚Äôs, Artist‚Äôs Edition, Patron)

**Description Length**
- Keep copy scannable (2‚Äì3 bullet points)
- Lead with the most compelling benefit
- End with urgency/scarcity when applicable

## Implementation Checklist

### Before Launch
- [ ] Test all images on mobile devices
- [ ] Verify consistent loading speeds
- [ ] Check contrast against your store background
- [ ] Ensure alt text is descriptive for accessibility
- [ ] Preview tiers in your actual Fundpop widget

### During Campaign
- [ ] Monitor which tiers perform best
- [ ] A/B test reward images if conversion is low
- [ ] Update quantities for limited tiers
- [ ] Adjust tier visibility based on performance

### Post‚ÄëCampaign Analysis
- [ ] Review conversion rates by tier
- [ ] Analyze which visual elements drove decisions
- [ ] Document learnings for future campaigns

## Advanced Techniques

### Psychological Pricing
The Hemeria example uses smart pricing gaps:
- ~36% jump from book to signed edition
- ~47% jump to the bundle tier
- ~127% jump to the premium tier

These create clear decision points without overwhelming choice.

### Scarcity Messaging
- ‚ÄúLimited Edition of 200‚Äù creates urgency
- Consider countdown timers for time‚Äëlimited tiers
- Use ‚ÄúOnly X remaining‚Äù for quantity‚Äëlimited rewards

### Bundle Strategy
- Combine complementary products rather than unrelated items
- Make bundle savings explicit and visible
- Ensure the bundle enhances the core offer

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

‚ùå Inconsistent image sizes
‚ùå Too many tier options (choice paralysis)
‚ùå Unclear value differences between tiers
‚ùå Generic product shots lacking exclusivity or emotion
‚ùå Missing mobile optimization

## Key Takeaways

1. Visual consistency builds trust
2. Clear value progression drives upgrades
3. Scarcity creates urgency
4. Bundle intelligently to enhance the core offer
5. Test and iterate based on performance
