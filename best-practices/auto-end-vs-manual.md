# ⚖️ Auto-End vs Manual Ending

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Premium feature — the "Auto-end on goal" option is available on Fundpop Premium plans.

### Default behavior

By default, Fundpop campaigns end automatically when the campaign’s scheduled end time (duration) is reached, even if the funding goal is not met yet. The "Auto-end on goal" option is an additional feature that ends the campaign as soon as the goal is reached — potentially before the scheduled end time.

### Use Auto-End When

* Inventory is constrained and overselling must be avoided
* You want a clean cutoff at the goal for messaging
* Operational simplicity is a priority

### Consider Manual Ending (or keeping the scheduled end) When

* You expect a surge past the goal and can fulfill extra demand
* You want to run a "48h last push" after hitting the target
* Your operations can buffer over-goal orders
