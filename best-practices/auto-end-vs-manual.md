# ⚖️ Auto-End vs Manual Ending

### Use Auto-End When

* Inventory is constrained and overselling must be avoided
* You want a clean cutoff at the goal for messaging
* Operational simplicity is a priority

### Consider Manual Ending When

* You expect a surge past the goal and can fulfill extra demand
* You want to run a "48h last push" after hitting the target
* Your operations can buffer over-goal orders
