<p>Due to <a href="https://shopify.dev/docs/apps/build/purchase-options/deferred#limitations">Shopify's single payment capture date limitation</a>, when a customer orders pre-order items from multiple campaigns in the same order, all items will be charged when the earliest campaign ends. Here's how different campaign combinations are handled:</p>
<ol>
<li>Multiple All-or-nothing Campaigns:
<ul>
<li>All items are charged when the earliest campaign ends</li>
<li>Each campaign's success/failure is handled independently:
<ul>
<li>If a campaign fails: Refund only items from that campaign</li>
<li>Success/failure of one campaign doesn't affect items from other campaigns</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Mix of All-or-nothing and Flexible Campaigns:
<ul>
<li>All items are charged when the earliest campaign ends</li>
<li>For All-or-nothing campaigns: Refund items only from campaigns that fail</li>
<li>For Flexible campaigns: Items keep payment regardless of goals</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Multiple Flexible Campaigns:
<ul>
<li>All items are charged when the earliest campaign ends</li>
<li>All items keep payments regardless of goals</li>
<li>No refunds needed</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Example: A customer orders items from three campaigns in the same order:</p>
<ul>
<li>Item A from Campaign 1 (All-or-nothing, ending March 1)</li>
<li>Item B from Campaign 2 (All-or-nothing, ending March 1)</li>
<li>Item C from Campaign 3 (Flexible, ending March 15)</li>
</ul>
<p>All items will be charged on March 1. Even though Campaign 1 and 2 end on the same date, their success/failure is evaluated independently. If Campaign 1 fails but Campaign 2 succeeds, only Item A needs to be cancelled. If both Campaign 1 and 2 fail, both Item A and B would need to be cancelled. Item C keeps its payment regardless of Campaign 3's outcome since it's a flexible campaign.</p>
