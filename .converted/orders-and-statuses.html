<p>When an order contains multiple pre-order products from different campaigns, the order status will change throughout the lifecycle of the campaigns. Here's how it works:</p>
<p><strong>Initial Status After Checkout</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>If the order only contains pre-order items, the status will be <strong>Pending</strong></li>
<li>If the order includes a pledge fee or regular (non-pre-order) products, the status will be <strong>Partially Paid</strong></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>When First Campaign Ends</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>When the first campaign reaches its end date, the status changes to <strong>Paid</strong></li>
<li>At this point, ALL pre-order items in the order are charged (not just items from the first campaign)</li>
<li>This happens because Shopify processes all deferred payments in an order based on the earliest due date</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>If Later Campaigns Fail</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>If a later (All-or-nothing) campaign fails, we automatically initiate a refund for items from that campaign only</li>
<li>The order status changes to <strong>Partially Refunded</strong></li>
<li>Items from successful campaigns remain paid and are not affected</li>
</ul>
<p>For example: An order contains pre-order Product A (Campaign 1) and pre-order Product B (Campaign 2):</p>
<ol>
<li>Initial status: <strong>Pending</strong></li>
<li>Campaign 1 succeeds and reaches end date: Status becomes <strong>Paid</strong> (both A and B are charged)</li>
<li>Campaign 2 fails: Status becomes <strong>Partially Refunded</strong> (refund issued for Product B only)</li>
</ol>
