# ðŸ’¡ About Fundpop

Fundpop is a Shopify app that empowers merchants to run crowdfunding and pre-order campaigns directly from their own stores. Unlike traditional crowdfunding platforms, Fundpop integrates seamlessly with your existing Shopify store, allowing you to:

* Launch campaigns while maintaining your brand identity
* Process payments through your existing Shopify setup
* Track campaign progress in real-time
* Offer pre-order options with an all-or-nothing or flexible funding model

With Fundpop, you can validate product ideas, secure funding before production, and build stronger connections with your community.
