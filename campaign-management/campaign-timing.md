# ⏱️ Campaign Timing

Manage when your campaign starts and ends, and automate ending on success.

### Adjusting End Date for Active Pre-order Campaigns

Extend an ongoing pre-order campaign when momentum increases and you want to keep collecting support.

Steps:

1. Open your campaign → Edit
2. In the Duration section, change the end date
3. Save changes

Effects:

* The campaign remains active until the new end date
* Widgets update automatically to reflect the new timeline



### Auto-End on Goal Achievement

Automatically end campaigns when the goal is reached to prevent overselling.

How to enable:

1. In Order Options, toggle "Auto-end on goal"
2. Save your campaign

Behavior:

* When the goal is achieved, the campaign ends immediately
* Pre-orders cannot be placed after auto-end
* Analytics reflect the final status
