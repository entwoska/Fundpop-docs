### Understanding Order Statuses

Orders can have the following statuses:

* **Pending**: Orders awaiting processing or payment
* **Paid**: Successfully completed orders
* **Authorized**: Pre-orders with authorized payment
* **Partially paid**: Pre-orders awaiting final payment
* **Cancelled**: Orders that have been cancelled
* **Closed**: Completed and archived orders

#### Essential Information

### Best Practices

#### Planning Campaign Timelines

* **Stagger campaign end dates**: Consider the implications of multiple campaigns ending simultaneously or close together
* **Coordinate shipping timelines**: Align campaign durations with your production and fulfillment schedules
* **Consider customer experience**: Plan campaigns to minimize potential partial refunds or split fulfillment

#### Managing Multiple Concurrent Campaigns

* **Monitor campaign performance**: Regularly check all active campaigns to identify any that might not reach their goals
* **Consider impact on mixed orders**: Be aware that customers may order products from multiple campaigns in a single transaction
* **Communicate clearly**: Ensure customers understand how mixed campaign orders work, especially regarding payment processing and potential refunds

#### Post-Campaign Actions

* **Review order statuses**: After campaigns end, check for any orders with status changes due to automatic payment processing
* **Monitor refunds**: For failed all-or-nothing campaigns, verify that appropriate refunds have been processed
* **Follow up with customers**: Send updates to customers who placed mixed orders, especially if some items were refunded due to failed campaigns

#### Payment Processing

* **Automatic captures**: Understand that Fundpop now automatically captures payments based on campaign type and success:
  * All-or-nothing: Automatic capture only if successful
  * Flexible: Automatic capture regardless of success
* **Mixed order handling**: Be aware that when one pre-order product in an order is due for payment, all pre-order products in that order will be charged together

Pro tip: Use the order status filters to focus on orders that need immediate attention, such as processing pending payments or handling partially paid orders.
