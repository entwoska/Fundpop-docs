### Step 2: Fundpop Widget

The Fundpop widget is what displays your campaign's progress on your store:

1. Choose your widget template:
   * Default template is pre-selected
   * Click "Open Templates" to browse other options
   * Use "+ New" to create a custom template
2. Preview your widget on the right side:

   * Standard/Pro plans: Up to 5 products per campaign

### Step 4: Campaign Goal

Set your funding target:

1. Choose your goal type:
   * Number of units: Track progress by quantity of products sold
   * Collected money: Set a monetary target
2. For collected money goals:
   * Enter your target amount
   * Optionally set initial funding
   * Add initial backer count if desired

{% hint style="info" %}
### Initial Funding and backer count

When setting up your campaign goal, you have the option to add initial funding to your campaign. This feature allows you to account for:

* Contributions collected offline or through other channels
* Pre-campaign commitments from early supporters
* Funding secured before the official campaign launch
* Previous sales that should count toward your campaign total

**How Initial Funding Works:**

* The initial funding amount is added to your campaign progress from the moment it launches
* Progress bars and statistics will reflect this initial amount immediately
* Your campaign's success calculation includes this initial funding when determining if you've hit your goal

### Step 5: Campaign Duration

Configure your campaign timeline:

1. Choose launch timing:
   * Launch now: Start immediately
   * Schedule launch time: Set future date/time
2. Set duration:
   * Use the slider to set campaign length
   * Enter specific number of days
   * Review exact start and end dates/times

### Step 6: Order Options

Define how backers will support your campaign:

Select order method:

* **Order now**: Immediate purchase and payment
* **Pre-order**: Delayed payment collection

For pre-order campaigns, choose:

* **All-or-nothing**: Campaign products are canceled if goal is not met
  * Only crowdfunding products are canceled if the campaign fails. Other products in the same order remain active.
* **Flexible**: No orders are canceled regardless of goal

For pre-order campaigns, you can set:

* A pledge fee: This is a small commitment payment that backers pay during the campaign, while the full payment is collected later. It helps ensure backer commitment and reduces the risk of cancellations. Choose between:
  * Fixed amount (e.g., $5)
  * Percentage of product price (e.g., 10%)
* Full payment is collected on campaign success
* For all-or-nothing campaigns, pledge fees are refunded if the campaign fail

The pre-order selling plan name helps customers identify their purchase as a pre-order during checkout. For example, you might enter **Pre-order - Ships January 2026** or **Early Bird Special**.

{% hint style="info" %}
#### Automatic Payment Processing

Fundpop automatically handles payments when campaigns end:

* **All-or-nothing campaigns**: Payments are automatically captured only if the campaign succeeds
* **Flexible campaigns**: Payments are automatically captured regardless of campaign success

This automation streamlines your post-campaign workflow and ensures timely payment processing. \
\
[‚ö†Ô∏è](https://emojipedia.org/warning) After a campaign ends, we recommend consulting your Fundpop dashboard to verify payment processing status. Review your Orders section to confirm all payments were successfully captured and  identify any orders that may require manual attention or intervention.

* Create milestones to incentivize early support
