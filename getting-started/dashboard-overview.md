# ðŸ“ˆ Dashboard Overview

### Performance Metrics

At the top of your dashboard, you'll find important campaign statistics for your selected time period:

* **Total fund raised**: The sum of all contributions across your campaigns
* **Total items sold**: Number of products sold through your campaigns
* **Total unique backers**: Count of individual supporters
* **Total milestone reached**: Number of achieved campaign milestones
* **Total successful campaigns**: Count of campaigns that met their goals

You can adjust the time period (default: 30 days) to view metrics for different timeframes.
