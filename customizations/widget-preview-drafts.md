# ðŸ§ª Previewing Widgets with Draft Campaigns

Use draft campaigns to validate your widget design, translations, and layout without publishing.

### How to Preview

1. Create or open a campaign and keep it in Draft status
2. Open the Theme Editor (Online Store â†’ Themes â†’ Customize)
3. Navigate to a page where your Fundpop widget appears
4. Enable the "Preview draft campaign" option in the editor controls

### What You Can Validate

* Layout and spacing in your theme
* Grid vs List display for Reward Tiers
* Translated texts rendering
* Progress bar and milestone animations

### Limitations

* Draft previews are visible only within the theme editor
* Storefront visitors do not see draft campaign widgets
* Some theme sections may cache content; reload the editor if changes are not visible

{% hint style="warning" %}
If your theme uses aggressive caching, the preview might take a moment to refresh. Reload the theme editor tab to pull updated data.
