# âž• Extended Widget Placement

### Homepage Integration

While we cover pinning campaigns to your homepage in the [Creating Your First Campaign](../getting-started/creating-your-first-campaign.md) section, here's a quick overview of this powerful feature:

* Pin any active campaign to your store's homepage
* Increase visibility for your most important campaigns
* Drive traffic directly to your campaign from your store's entry point

To pin a campaign to your homepage:

1. Navigate to the campaign in your dashboard
2. Find "Pin Fundpop widget on store homepage" option
3. Click "Pin campaign"

Note: Only one campaign can be pinned at a time; pinning a new campaign will replace any previously pinned campaign.

### Product Card Progress Bar (recommended)

Display progress directly under product cards in collections using the dedicated widget.

* Use the [Product Card Progress Bar](../widgets/product-card-progress-bar.md) widget for a maintainable integration
* Customize colors/sizes in the theme editor
* Avoids the need for custom integration

### Collection-Specific Widgets

Target campaign widgets to only appear on selected product collections for more relevant promotion and a cleaner store experience.

How to set it up:

1. Open your campaign's widget settings
2. Find the Collections targeting section
3. Select one or more collections where the widget should appear
4. Save your changes

Behavior:

* The widget will be rendered only on product pages within the selected collections
* If no collection is selected, the widget follows your normal placement rules
