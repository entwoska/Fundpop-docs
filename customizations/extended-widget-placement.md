# âž• Extended Widget Placement

### Homepage Integration

While we cover pinning campaigns to your homepage in the [Creating Your First Campaign](../getting-started/creating-your-first-campaign.md) section, here's a quick overview of this powerful feature:

* Pin any active campaign to your store's homepage
* Increase visibility for your most important campaigns
* Drive traffic directly to your campaign from your store's entry point

To pin a campaign to your homepage:

1. Navigate to the campaign in your dashboard
2. Find "Pin Fundpop widget on store homepage" option
3. Click "Pin campaign"

Note: Only one campaign can be pinned at a time; pinning a new campaign will replace any previously pinned campaign.

### Collection View Integration

With custom development support from our team, you can display campaign progress directly in collection views:

* Show progress bars under product cards in collection listings
* Increase campaign visibility as customers browse your store
* Create urgency and interest before customers even reach the product page

This integration requires custom code implementation. Contact our development team at [info@fizzy.studio](mailto:info@fizzy.studio) or on our in-app chat to enable collection view integration for your store.
