### Creating a Reward Tier

To set up a reward tier for your campaign:

1. Select your campaign product
   * Choose the main product to associate with the reward tier
   * This serves as the base for your bundle
2. Add reward information:
   * Upload a cover image (supports .gif, .jpg, and .png)
   * Add a title (50 character limit)
   * Write a compelling description using the rich text editor

Hide tiers temporarily for upcoming special offers or when they're no longer available. You can easily toggle visibility without deleting the tier.</p></figcaption></figure>

#### Reward Tier Products

Add products to create your bundle:

* Search or browse your store's inventory
* Select products to include
* Bundle can contain multiple items

{% hint style="warning" %}
**Note:** Some products may not be available for selection in reward tiers due to the following reasons:

1. The product is out of stock
2. The product is still in draft status (not published)
3. The product is already active in another campaign
4. The product doesn't have at least one variant (Create a "Default" variant if needed)

If you don't see a product you're looking for when creating reward tiers, check these conditions to resolve the issue.

#### Pricing Options

Configure how your reward tier is priced:

1. Choose your pricing model:
   * Fixed price: Set a specific price for the bundle
   * Discount on total: Apply a percentage or fixed discount to the bundle
2. Customize the purchase button:
   * Set button text (default: "Claim this perk")
   * Choose button and text colors to match your brand

#### Availability Settings

Control access to your reward tier:

1. Reward Quantity
   * Unlimited: No restriction on number of backers
   * Limited: Set a maximum number of available spots
2. Time Limit
   * No limit: Available throughout the campaign
   * Specify start and end: Set custom availability window
   * Options to align with campaign timing:
     * Start on campaign launch
     * End when campaign ends

#### Visibility

Manage when backers can see your reward tier:

* Visible: Reward tier is available for purchase
* Hidden: Temporarily hide the tier (useful for upcoming or expired rewards)

### Best Practices

1. Creating Attractive Tiers
   * Offer clear value progression between tiers
   * Include exclusive items or perks
   * Make descriptions clear and compelling
2. Pricing Strategy
   * Set logical price increments between tiers
   * Ensure discounts are attractive but sustainable
   * Consider your profit margins
3. Managing Availability
   * Use limited quantities to create urgency
   * Set strategic time windows for special offers
   * Keep track of remaining spots

### Homepage and Bundle Display

You can display reward tiers directly on your homepage and bundle product pages, increasing visibility and conversion opportunities:

* **Homepage Display**: Showcase selected reward tiers on your store's homepage to attract immediate attention
* **Bundle Product Pages**: Display relevant reward tiers on bundle product pages
* **Confirmation Dialog**: A confirmation prompt appears when pinning reward tiers to ensure intentional changes
