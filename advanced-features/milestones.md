### Creating Milestones

To set up a milestone for your campaign:

1. Navigate to your campaign's milestone section
2. Click "Create milestone"

#### Setting the Target

Enter the target number that will trigger your milestone. This can be:

* A number of units sold (for unit-based campaigns)
* An amount raised (for money-based campaigns)

#### Choosing Reward Options

Select one of two reward types:

1. **Existing Product**
   * Choose a product from your store's inventory
   * Perfect for offering physical rewards
   * Selected product will be automatically added to qualifying orders
2. **Reward Reveal**
   * Announce special perks or future benefits
   * Reveal exclusive content or announcements
   * Share coupon codes or special offers

When using Reward Reveal, you can:

* Upload a photo to represent the reward or milestone
* Add a title for your milestone
* Write descriptions for before and after the milestone is reached

#### Backer Reward Options

Configure who receives the milestone reward:

* **Reward all backers**: Everyone who supported the campaign gets the reward, including those who contributed before the milestone was reached
* **New backers only**: Only supporters who back after the milestone is achieved receive the reward
